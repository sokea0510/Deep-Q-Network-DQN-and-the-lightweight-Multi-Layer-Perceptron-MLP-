# Deep-Q-Network-DQN-and-the-lightweight-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-MLP-
The comparison between Deep Q-Network (DQN) and the lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) highlights several critical insights into their behavior in a class-imbalanced setting for parent-child interaction recognition.


This study demonstrates that while reinforcement learning methods like DQN hold promise for behavior recognition, they require careful tuning, especially in imbalanced data scenarios. Simple supervised models, if designed carefully, can outperform complex agents when sample distribution and optimization dynamics are well understood.
